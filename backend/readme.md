In Postman 
We canâ€™t send a JSON body with a GET request. Therefore create, update, delete is not GET Method 
Only /get route is mapped with GET method bcoz we are not sending anything here , juat extracting the data 
whereas in /get_all , we are sending id in Postman to get the specific user that's why using POST here
